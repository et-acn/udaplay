      "['**Like many gamers my age, the Game Boy was the first handheld system I owned, and I still remember it fondly.** I got it for Christmas in 4th grade with both Link’s Awakening (as a pack-in) and Wario Land. I saw it on a few other “best Game Boy games” lists and decided to order a cart and manual from eBay. While nowhere near as refined as beat ’em up entries like the exquisite Turtles in Time, it’s a solid action title! I love Six Golden Coins-it’s not just one of the best Game Boy games but easily one of my top 10 Mario games! The Switch remake was also a joy to play, but I will always prefer the original release on Game Boy for the nostalgia.', \"As an 8 year old kid in 1989, the first time I ever saw a Game Boy my cousin was using what is essentially a book light to play Tetris on this blurry, pea-soup-green screen. Probably the best game I have played on the GB so far. The first 3 SaGa games (Final Fantasy Legend 1-3) are some of my favourite original GB games. Since you have an Analogue, I highly recommend Metal Gear Solid, Mario Tennis, Super Mario Bros Deluxe, Wario Land 3, Pokemon Silver/Gold/Crystal, and both Zelda games for GBC. You already got DK '94, so I suggest Link's Awakening (arguably the best game on the system) and all of the Final Fantasy games (Final Fantasy Legend 1-3 are fun old-school RPGs & Final Fantasy Adventure is a fun Zelda-like with a killer soundtrack).
