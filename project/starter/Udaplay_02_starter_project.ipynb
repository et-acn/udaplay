I saw it on a few other “best Game Boy games” lists and decided to order a cart and manual from eBay. While nowhere near as refined as beat ’em up entries like the exquisite Turtles in Time, it’s a solid action title! I love Six Golden Coins-it’s not just one of the best Game Boy games but easily one of my top 10 Mario games! The Switch remake was also a joy to play, but I will always prefer the original release on Game Boy for the nostalgia.', \"Here's my list: -All 5 Mega Man/Rockman World games (althogh MMII/RW2 is a mess) -Mole Mania -Zoop -Mario's Picross -Picross 2 -Donkey Kong\", '| *Pokémon Yellow* | Game Freak | Nintendo | GB | September 12, 1998 | 14,600,000 |  |. | *Tetris \"Tetris (Game Boy video game)\")* † | Nintendo R&D1 | Nintendo | GB | June 14, 1989 | 35,000,000 |  |. | *Yoshi \"Yoshi (video game)\")* | Game Freak | Nintendo | GB | December 14, 1991 | 3,120,000 |  |. | *Tennis \"Tennis (1984 video game)\")* | Nintendo R&D1 | Nintendo | GB | May 29, 1989 | 1,990,000 |  |. | *Alleyway \"Alleyway (video game)\")* | * Nintendo R&D1 * Intelligent Systems | Nintendo | GB | April 21, 1989 | 1,940,000 |  |. | *Baseball \"Baseball (1983 video game)\")* | Nintendo R&D1 | Nintendo | GB | April 21, 1989 | 1,610,000 |  |. | *Tetris 2 \"Tetris 2 (1993 video game)\")* | * Nintendo R&D1 * Tose \"Tose (company)\") | Nintendo | GB | December 1993 | 1,240,000 |  |.', \"Pokemon Red/Blue · LoZ: Link's Awakening · Kirby's Dream Land 1 & 2 · Cave Noire (JPN-exclusive, but there are translated versions out there).\", 'With many of the glitches from the original game taken out, rich colour schemes and new animated elements added, the option to play as Luigi, and lots of other hidden surprises for gamers to try and spot, Mario Bros Deluxe is one of those titles that will keep you coming back time and time again. The levels in this colourful RPG are kind of reminiscent of a Legend Of Zelda title, and the gameplay has a lot of similarities to the Pokemon series in the form of in-game breeding of your Dragon Warrior Monsters. This single-player action-adventure title follows the same theme and uses the same gaming engine as the first GBC Tomb Raider game, though this time there are more clever puzzles to solve, new challenges to overcome, and some pretty annoying bad guys that you’ll enjoy defeating over and over again.']\n"
